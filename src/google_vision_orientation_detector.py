        IMPORTANT RULES:
        1. Look at the MAIN content (text, photos, official stamps, logos) to determine orientation.
        2. If the main text is upside-down or sideways, the image needs rotation.
        3. If the document title/header is upside-down, the image needs rotation.
        4. If official stamps or seals are upside-down, the image needs rotation.
        5. For certificates: If the university name, degree title, or main text is upside-down, rotate it.
        6. For IDs: If the photo or main text is upside-down, rotate it.
        7. For passports: If the passport photo or main text is upside-down, rotate it.
        8. Only ignore rotation if ALL main content appears correctly oriented.
        
        If rotation is needed, tell me the angle of rotation (90, 180, 270 degrees).
        Only reply with a single number: 0, 90, 180, or 270.
